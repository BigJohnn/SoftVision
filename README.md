# SoftVision
Open Source Soft Vision Framework.

Adapted && subtraction from [AliceVision](https://github.com/AliceVision), but the depthmap process is implemented in apple's metal framework.

Designed to have thin package and fast speed, thus can be applied to mobile devices, such as a mobilephone with only rgb camera(s).

RoadMap for iOS:

> Prepare Input Data: Essential SwiftUI for camera meta data aquirement, done.
> (SIFT)Feature Extracting, done.

> Image Matching, assumed to have done, todo.

> (SIFT)Feature Matching done.

> Structure From Motion done.

> PrepareDenseScene done.

ToDoList:

> DepthMap. # with gpu, metal acc (translation done, but need more test)

> DepthMapFilter.

> Meshing.

> MeshFiltering.

> Texture Mapping.
